# RewindTube
This service allows you to save any video or channel from YouTube to memory, and watch it when the original is deleted from YouTube.

***Important note**: it is highly advisable to ask the author of the channel if he wants to save his deleted videos, since there is a separate category of authors who do not want their deleted videos to be seen by someone else besides themselves.*
